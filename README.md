# DAT-LCR-Rot-hop++

Cross-Domain (CD) Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification (ABSC) using LCR-Rot-hop++ with Domain Adversarial Training (DAT).

## Set-up instructions.

- Set-up a virtual environment:
    - Make sure you have a recent release of Python installed (we used Python 3.7), if not download
      from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - Download Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
    - Set-up a virtual environment in Anaconda using Python 3.7 in order to be able to install protobuf 3.19 and tensorflow 1.15 package. Newer versions of python are incompatible.
    - Install the requirements by running the following command:
      ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    - Copy all software from this repository into a file in the virtual environment.
    
## How to use?
- Adjust the paths in config.py, main$\_$test.py, and main$\_$hyper.py 
- Get raw data for your required domains by running raw$\_$data.py for restaurant, laptop, and book domain.
- Get BERT embeddings by running generate_bert_embeddings.ipynb for your required domains *using Google Colab* to obtain BERT embeddings or download them from ... and put them in correct folder: "\getBERT\dataBERT". 
- Run prepare_bert.py for your required domains.
- Tune hyperparameters to your specific task using main_hyper.py or use hyperparameters as pre-set in main_test.py.
- Select tests to run and run main_test.py (running all tests will take a long time, 5-8 minutes per iteration). Make
  sure write_result is set to True if you want the results to be saved to a text file.
